# Board games design cathalogue

This is a cathalogue of learning resources to desing board games, wargames, Megagames, roleplaying games, bookgames (I love the word Librojuego) and tabletop games. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I find more resources. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

For now we have the following sections:

- Libros
- Cursos
- Sitios web

Please feel free to add any resources you think are useful. You can do this by forking the repository and creating a pull request, or by opening an issue with your suggestions.

If you want and you are interested to contribute, please do it using the following format:

- For Libros, add the name and author and all the information you have about it.
- For Cursos, just add the name below the last one and send a PR.
- For Sitios web, do the same as for cursos, but add when you checked the link and if it is still active or not.

If you dont have all the information, dont worry, just add what you have and I will try to update it later.  
If you have a cover image for the books, use the folder images/book_covers with the isbn number as the name of the image. Leave the last commented section for others.

At last, remember that this is to help others about game design, not video game design, so please keep it in mind when adding resources. At least for now, I will not add any video game design resources (that could be another section maybe). That is for courses, books and websites. Also, it is not to find rules, books or something like that.

What it is in spanglish?, because I know more spanish speaking designers than english speaking ones, and I want to try to add more content in spanish than in english.
